# osigma

Osigma is an open-source JavaScript library aimed at visualizing sparse graphs of millions of nodes and billions of edges. This code is based on [sigma.js](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js) with optimization for graph structure that replaces [graphology](https://github.com/graphology/graphology) with a simpler, but more memory- and computation-efficient structure.
